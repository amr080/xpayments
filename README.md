# Dapp Starter Kit(React)

This is a starter kit for building decentralized applications (Dapps) using React, Hardhat, Tailwind CSS, and ethers.js. The template provides a basic structure and components to help you get started quickly with Dapp development. It is mobile-responsive and comes with a dark mode switcher

## Features

- **React**: The template is built with Create React App (CRA), a popular React boilerplate.
- **Hardhat**: Hardhat is used as the development environment and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The template utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a utility-first CSS framework.
- **Ethers.js**: Ethers.js is used as the Ethereum library for interacting with wallets and contracts.
